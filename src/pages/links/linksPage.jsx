                this application written in Java android is designed to
                demonstrate how to leverage the NFC capabilities to create
                messages holding multiple records so the user can save and store
                usernames and passwords.
                <br />
                <br />
                the user has the ability to enter a username and password on the
                main activity screen and is given the option to write the
                credentials to an NFC chip. at which point the application will
                use the NFC capabilities within the phone to save those
                credentials. once card with saved credentials is scanned the
                application will fill in the fields appropriately.
                <br />
                <br />
                the user also has the option to "log in" using the given or
                scanned credentials at which point the application will use an
                SQLite database to retrieve any saved credentials into a
                populated list for the user to then choose from to write onto
                the NFC card or add to the list.

                Through my short experience actively trying to create YouTube
                content I learned many things; such as branding, many elements
                of Graphic Design, Video production from scripting to lighting
                and storyboarding as well as creating a workflow to carry an
                idea from inception to final product. I wouldnâ€™t call myself an
                expert in these by any means however I did develop many life
                long skills through the process. And peeking at 900 and change
                subscribers before starting school and becoming too busy to
                pursue YouTube I am very proud of the content I made.
